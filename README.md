# App-Market-Web-Crawler

App Markets including `XIAOMI`, `HUAWEI`, `YINGYONGBAO`, `WANDOUJIA`


This this my first time to write a web crawler code based on python3.6, it might not very efficient,<br> 
but i will keep on trying to improve it.


The WANDOUJIA market crawler is based on Xpath package, but the other three markets crawler are based<br> 
on bs4 package, because info structure of different websites are diversity, you should use different<br> 
tools(packages) to get what you need.


PS: I do recommend that you should learn some html knowledge before you start to do web crawlers.
