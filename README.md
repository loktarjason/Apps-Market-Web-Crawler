# Apps-Market-Web-Crawler
Apps Markets including XIAOMI, HUAWEI, YINGYONGBAO, WANDOUJIA


This this my first time to write a web crawler code based on python3.6, it might not very efficient, but i will keep on trying to improve it.


The WANDOUJIA market crawler is based on Xpath package, but the other three markets crawler are based on bs4 package, because info structure of different websites are diversity, you should use different tools(packages) to get what you need.


PS: I do recommend that you should learn some html knowledge before you start to do web crawlers.
